# Simulation Project

This project simulates a perfect grid graph using NetworkX and calculates its "orientation order" with OSMNX.

## Project Structure

```

├── src
│   ├── main.py          # Entry point of the simulation
│   └── utils
│       └── graph_utils.py # Utility functions for graph operations
├── requirements.txt     # Project dependencies
└── README.md            # Project documentation
```

## Installation

To set up the project, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the following command:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

This will create a perfect grid graph and calculate its orientation order.

## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python packages:

- OSMNX
- NetworkX

Make sure to have these installed before running the simulation.
